Checkers Board Program Intro

1. The program is designed with Java in Eclipse. You may need to import to Eclipse to run this code;
2. The program is helped with a .jar file called gagawa-1.0.1.jar. You may find more detailed info here:
   http://code.google.com/p/gagawa/source/browse/trunk/gagawa/
3. After running the code, a file called CheckersBoard.html should be found in the current folder(The folder called CheckersBoard). You may open it to test because all other files(app.js, style.css and images) are also in the same folder.
4. A sample html result file called CheckersBoard-sample.html is also in the folder. It is exactly the same with CheckersBoard.html that you generate except it's formated in a neat order.
5. The program and its generated html file meet all the requirements. Besides, the checker can tie to players and the next move will be also shown on the top center.
